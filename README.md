Lên git tạo pull requests.

1. Each member should have their own branch to work on. Avoid working directly on the main branch (master/main).
2. Before starting work, update your branch to be up-to-date with the main branch by pulling from main.
3. After completing work on your branch, create a pull request to propose merging your code into the main branch.
4. Name branches, commit messages, and pull requests in a clear, understandable way.
5. Do not commit unnecessary changes or temporary files to the repository.
6. Before merging a pull request, other members should review the code and approve the pull request.
7. Resolve any conflicts before merging a pull request.
8. After a pull request is merged, remember to delete the branch to keep things clean.
9. Periodically fetch and rebase your branch with main to keep your local copy up-to-date.
